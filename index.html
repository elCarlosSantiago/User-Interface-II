                A small collection of the projects I've been involved with. All important experiences from a previous life. The sum of which has brought us here.
                <br> Listen to this short story, It's stuck with me for a while.</p>

            <p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them
                looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”
